#FSU Entrance "Exam"

Hello developer, and thanks for your interest in applying to FSU. We have a task for you (aren't you lucky?). Contained within the subdirectories are ugly programs in a variety of languages, that provide an API for basic geolocation based on the first thirty entries in the MaxMind Lite database, in `/source.json`.

Each of these allow you to:

 * List all available GeoIP entries
 * Geolocate an IP to its country
 * Retrieve and list the IPs assigned to each country

Now, all this code works, but is intentionally ugly and unreadable. Your task is to take one of these projects - whatever language you feel most comfortable with - and turn it into a nice and readable API. Bonus points for implementing unit testing or additional nifty features.

Good luck!
