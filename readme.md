#FSU Entrance "Exam"

Hello developer, and thanks for your interest in applying to FSU. We have a task for you (aren't you lucky?). Contained within the subdirectories are ugly CLI programs in a variety of languages, that provide an API for basic geolocation based on the first thirty entries in the MaxMind Lite database, in `/source.json`.

Each of these allow you to:

 * List all available GeoIP entries
 * Geolocate an IP to its country
 * Retrieve and list the IPs assigned to each country

Now, all this code works, but is intentionally ugly and unreadable. Your task is to take one of these projects - whatever language you feel most comfortable with - and turn it into a nice and readable API. Bonus points for implementing unit testing or additional nifty features.

Your application must expose the same external interface as the original application (same commands and arguments), and must be functional.

Good luck!
